# ðŸ“ˆ Adolescents Reach Monitoring Dynamic Excel Dashboard

## About this Project
In response to the need for collaborative and real-time updates on a development project for adolescents, I developed this Excel-based database to support MEAL functions specifically data tracking and information needs for implementing teams. This was in response to challenges in tracking sex disaggregated reach and sharing large volumes of sensitive data across teams across differing contexts.

This database provides a easy to follow and collaborative database to respond to immediate needs of implementers with dynamic visualization components. It enables tracking of project reach and actionable insights for field teams, technical leads, and program managers.

## Purpose
This was developed to support routine monitoring, timely analysis, and use of disaggregated reach data for 
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Evidence-based planning
- Enhanced accountability across implementing teams

## Key Features of the database and dashboard
- **Relational easy to use database**: Interlinked sheets using array formulas and data validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard which updates at update and gives snapshot information
- **Disaggregation**: Data broken down by sex and intervention
- **Performance Highlights**: Summary metrics that highlight gaps, progress, and priority areas for improvement.
- **Actionable Outputs**: Summarized data used to prioritize and guide project decisions

## Structure of the File

| Sheet Name            | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `Database`            | Core data entry sheet. Captures individual-level participant information including age, sex, intervention type, and reach data. |
| `Dashboard`           | Visual display of key performance metrics. Automatically updates with new data entries. |
| `Summaries`           | Aggregated statistics for reporting and planning purposes. Highlights trends and comparisons over time. |
| `Age_Sex_Breakdown`   | Pre-filtered summary table disaggregated by age and sex. |
| `Intervention_Summary`| Disaggregation by type of intervention. Useful for thematic or technical leads. |
| `Validation_Lists`    | Lookup and dropdown value lists to standardize entries and avoid data inconsistency. |
| `Instructions`        | Embedded guidance for data entry, navigation, and general use. Useful for onboarding new users. |

## MEAL Value-Add 
- **Program Ownership**: Field teams are empowered to track and interpret their own reach data.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Saved time used in tedious corrections in files shared through emails which affected the versions and risk of data loss 
- **Real-Time Decision Support**: Dashboard enables immediate insight into underperforming areas and overachievements.
- **Ethical information handling**: Capped the need to share sensitive data over emails which could be a risk 
- **Evidence of Progress**: Tracked over 30,000 adolescents and enabled a reach increase from 7% (mid-2022) to 101% (April 2023).

## Conclusion
- Simple solutions can go along way in delivering development project outcomes, Keeping It Simple for all.
